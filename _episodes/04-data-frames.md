- "Use `str()`, `summary()`, `nrow()`, `ncol()`, `dim()`, `colnames()`, `rownames()`, `head()`, and `typeof()` to understand the structure of a data frame."
- "Read in a csv file using `read.csv()`."
- "Understand what `length()` of a data frame represents."

## Realistic example
So far, you have seen the basics of data frames with our cat data;
now let's use those skills to digest a more realistic dataset. Let's read in the
`gapminder` dataset that we downloaded previously:


~~~
gapminder <- read.csv("data/gapminder_data.csv", stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
~~~
{: .language-r}

> ## Miscellaneous Tips
>
> * Another type of file you might encounter are tab-separated value files (.tsv). To specify a tab as a separator, use `"\\t"` or `read.delim()`.
>
> * Files can also be downloaded directly from the Internet into a local
> folder of your choice onto your computer using the `download.file` function.
> The `read.csv` function can then be executed to read the downloaded file from the download location, for example,
> 
> ~~~
> download.file("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/swcarpentry/r-novice-gapminder/gh-pages/_episodes_rmd/data/gapminder_data.csv", destfile = "data/gapminder_data.csv")
> gapminder <- read.csv("data/gapminder_data.csv", stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
> ~~~
> {: .language-r}
>
> * Alternatively, you can also read in files directly into R from the Internet by replacing the file paths with a web address in `read.csv`. One should note that in doing this no local copy of the csv file is first saved onto your computer. For example,
> 
> ~~~
> gapminder <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/swcarpentry/r-novice-gapminder/gh-pages/_episodes_rmd/data/gapminder_data.csv", stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
> ~~~
> {: .language-r}
>
> * You can read directly from excel spreadsheets without
> converting them to plain text first by using the [readxl](https://cran.r-project.org/package=readxl) package.

Let's investigate gapminder a bit; the first thing we should always do is check
out what the data looks like with `str`:


~~~
str(gapminder)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
'data.frame':	1704 obs. of  6 variables:
 $ country  : Factor w/ 142 levels "Afghanistan",..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...
 $ year     : int  1952 1957 1962 1967 1972 1977 1982 1987 1992 1997 ...
 $ pop      : num  8425333 9240934 10267083 11537966 13079460 ...
 $ continent: Factor w/ 5 levels "Africa","Americas",..: 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 ...
 $ lifeExp  : num  28.8 30.3 32 34 36.1 ...
 $ gdpPercap: num  779 821 853 836 740 ...
~~~
{: .output}

An additional method for examining the structure of gapminder is to use the `summary` function. This function can be used on various objects in R. For data frames, `summary` yields a numeric, tabular, or descriptive summary of each column. Factor columns are summarized by the number of items in each level, numeric or integer columns by the descriptive statistics (quartiles and mean), and character columns by its length, class, and mode.  


~~~
summary(gapminder$country)

{: .language-r}

{: .output}

Along with the `str` and `summary` functions, we can examine individual columns of the data frame with our `typeof` function:


~~~
typeof(gapminder$year)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] "integer"
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
typeof(gapminder$country)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] "integer"
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
str(gapminder$country)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
 Factor w/ 142 levels "Afghanistan",..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...
~~~
{: .output}

We can also interrogate the data frame for information about its dimensions;
remembering that `str(gapminder)` said there were 1704 observations of 6
variables in gapminder, what do you think the following will produce, and why?


~~~
length(gapminder)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] 6
~~~
{: .output}

A fair guess would have been to say that the length of a data frame would be the
number of rows it has (1704), but this is not the case; remember, a data frame
is a *list of vectors and factors*:


~~~
typeof(gapminder)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] "list"
~~~
{: .output}

When `length` gave us 6, it's because gapminder is built out of a list of 6
columns. To get the number of rows and columns in our dataset, try:


~~~
nrow(gapminder)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] 1704
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
ncol(gapminder)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] 6
~~~
{: .output}

Or, both at once:


~~~
dim(gapminder)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] 1704    6
~~~
{: .output}

We'll also likely want to know what the titles of all the columns are, so we can
ask for them later:


~~~
colnames(gapminder)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] "country"   "year"      "pop"       "continent" "lifeExp"   "gdpPercap"
~~~
{: .output}

At this stage, it's important to ask ourselves if the structure R is reporting
matches our intuition or expectations; do the basic data types reported for each
column make sense? If not, we need to sort any problems out now before they turn
into bad surprises down the road, using what we've learned about how R
interprets data, and the importance of *strict consistency* in how we record our
data.

Once we're happy that the data types and structures seem reasonable, it's time
to start digging into our data proper. Check out the first few lines:


~~~
head(gapminder)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
